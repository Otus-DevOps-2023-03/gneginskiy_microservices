#image inspection:
docker inspect e508acf09e6b

#container inspection:
docker inspect 1dc0294b33dd
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task (*):

A Docker container is a running or stopped instance of an image,
and the docker inspect <container_id> command provides details about that specific container instance.

A Docker image is a snapshot of a filesystem and configuration settings used to create containers.
The docker inspect <image_id> command provides information about the image itself,
which can be used to create multiple containers with similar configurations.

Inspecting a container, we can see that it differs from the image inspection output.
The difference is comprised of json objects "HostConfig", "NetworkSettings","State" and more,
which seemingly makes more sense for a container, rather than for an image.
